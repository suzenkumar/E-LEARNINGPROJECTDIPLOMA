            <h2>Internet</h2>
            <p>The internet is the wider network that allows computer networks around the world run by companies, governments, universities and other organisations to talk to one another. The result is a mass of cables, computers, data centres, routers, servers, repeaters, satellites and wi-fi towers that allows digital information to travel around the world.</p>

            <h2>Motivation for Internet Working</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>LAN technologies provide high speed communication across short distances.</li>
                <li>WAN technologies serves large areas.</li>
                <li>No single networking technology is best for all needs.</li>
                <li>Example: Ethernet might be the best solution for connecting computers in an office.</li>
                <li>Example: Frame relay might be the best solution for interconnecting computers from one city to another.</li>

            <h2>Internet Architecture Board</h2>
            <p>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is a board of researchers and professionals that manages the engineering and technical development related to the Internet. IAB offers assistance and insight on a wide range of Internet-related concerns. Professional entities, standards agencies, and other organizations frequently use IAB as a reference for network expertise.</p>
            <p>IAB manages several task forces, including the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). IAB was originally established as the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB) in 1979. Adopting several names afterwards, it finally became the IAB in 1992.</p>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage and publish Request for Comments (RFC).</li>
                <li>Oversee the Internet standard process.</li>
                <li>Oversee the IETF.</li>
                <li>Architectural Supervision: Responsible for overseeing different network and Internet Protocol (IP) architectural standards.</li>
                <li>Appeals and Standards Process Supervision: The appeal board was established to review standard issues and related appeals.</li>
                <li>Advice for Internet Societies: Provides guidance to ISOC officials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although IAB arranges groups for developing technical principles and ideas, it generally does not build comprehensive implementation plans. IAB's main objective is to help the IETF improve Internet standardization. The IAB is rarely associated with policy decisions and usually does not address the Internet's operational or commercial elements.</p>
