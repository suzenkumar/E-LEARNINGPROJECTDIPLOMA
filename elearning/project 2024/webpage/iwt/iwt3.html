                <h1 class="text-center">UNIT-3: Internet Security</h1>
                <p>Internet security is a branch of computer security which comprises various security measures exercised for ensuring the security of transactions done online. In the process, the internet security prevents attacks targeted at browsers, network, operating systems, and other applications.</p>

                <h2>Types of Security</h2>
                <h3>Network Layer Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>TCP/IP can be made secure with the help of cryptographic methods and protocols.</li>
                    <li>These protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS) for web traffic, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for email, and IPsec for the network layer security.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This protocol is designed to protect communication in a secure manner using TCP/IP.</li>
                    <li>It is a set of security extensions developed by the Internet Task Force (IETF), and it provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption.</li>
                    <li>Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Electronic Mail Security (E-mail)</h3>
                <p>Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing an email message to ensure its integrity and confirm the identity of its sender.</li>
                    <li>Encrypting the body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality.</li>
                    <li>Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Authentication & Authorization</h3>
                <p>Authentication is a process of identifying and verifying who is sending a request. Authorization is a process to provide access rights to the individuals.</p>
                
                <h2>Firewall</h2>
                <p>A Firewall is simply a program or hardware device that filters the information coming through the internet connection into your private network or computer system.</p>
                
                <h3>The Role of Firewalls</h3>
                <p>A firewall is used as a “barrier” between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the internet.</p>
                
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Host-based Firewalls</li>
                    <li>Network-based Firewalls</li>
                </ul>
