        <h2 class="mt-5">Database Management System (DBMS):</h2>
        <p class="lead">A database management system consists of a collection of related data and refers to a set of programs for defining, creating, maintaining, and manipulating a database.</p>

        <h3>Database:</h3>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of related data of an organization stored in a formatted way which is shared by multiple users.</p>

        <ol type="i">
            <li>It must be well organized</li>
            <li>It is related</li>
            <li>It is accessible in a logical order without any difficulty</li>
            <li>It is stored only once. For example, consider the roll no, name, address of a student stored in a student file. It is a collection of related data with an implicit meaning.</li>
            <li>Data in the database may be persistent, integrated, and shared.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Persistent:</h4>
        <p>If data is removed from the database due to some explicit request from the user.</p>
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Integrated:</h4>
        <p>A database can be a collection of data from different files and when any redundancy among those files is removed from the database is said to be integrated data.</p>
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sharing Data:</h4>
        <p>The data stored in the database can be shared by multiple users simultaneously without affecting the correctness of data.</p>

        <h3>Why Database:</h3>
        <p>In order to overcome the limitation of a file system, a new approach was required. Hence, a database approach emerged. A database is a persistent collection of logically related data. The initial attempts were to provide a centralized collection of data. A database has a self-describing nature. It contains not only the data sharing and integration of data of an organization in a single database.</p>
        <p>A small database can be handled manually but for a large database and having multiple users it is difficult to maintain it. In that case, a computerized database is useful. The advantages of a database system over traditional, paper-based methods of record-keeping are:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Compactness: No need for large amounts of paper files.</li>
            <li>Speed: The machine can retrieve and modify the data more quickly than a human being.</li>
            <li>Less Drudgery: Much of the maintenance of files by hand is eliminated.</li>
            <li>Accuracy: Accurate, up-to-date information is fetched as per the requirement of the user at any time.</li>
        </ol>
